    <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour/li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
